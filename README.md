## Usage

The Study Guide is organized into Four sections (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) that include steps necessary to learning how to build a working website, one that is intended for students doing Bootcamp Prework.  Under each section the user will find key study suggestions that are necessary to understanding each section.  Using DevTools Console one can see the working JavaScript which suggests topics to study at random and also the list of topics in the study guide.  Because the suggestions are random, the study guide can be frequently revisited to access suggestions of what to study in a fun way; the user can this way attain good proficiency by repetition.
